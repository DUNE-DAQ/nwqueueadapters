/**
 * @brief NetworkObjectReceiver receives objects over IPM connections
 *
 * NetworkObjectReceiver and its counterpart NetworkObjectSender
 * provide a convenient interface to object serialization/sending
 * and receiving/deserialization over network connections. Any class
 * which can be converted to/from an @c nlohmann::json object can be
 * used; in particular, all classes generated with moo schema are
 * suitable for use with NetworkObjectSender/Receiver
 *
 * Typical usage:
 *
 * @code
 * NetworkObjectReceiver<MyClass> receiver(conf_object);
 * MyClass m = receiver.recv(m, std::chrono::milliseconds(200));
 * @endcode
